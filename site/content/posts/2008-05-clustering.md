In early April eleven of my local writer friends and I held a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dhemery/WritersRetreat" title="Photo gallery of the SacNaNo/WordForge Spring 2008 Writer's Retreat">weekend writer's retreat</a> at a dome house in the Sierra Nevada foothills.

One of my goals for the retreat was to practice developing ideas into story ideas, and then into stories.  And I had a technique in mind that I wanted to practice: <em>clustering</em>.

I'd learned about clustering years ago from a writing teacher in New Hampshire, who had learned it from Gabriele Rico's book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0874779618/dalehemery-20">Writing the Natural Way</a></em>.  Dustin Wax <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/rico-clusters-an-alternative-to-mind-mapping.html" title="Dustin Wax's description of Gabriele Rico's clustering technique">describes the technique nicely</a> on his blog, and you can see a Flash animation of clustering in action <a href="http://www.gabrielerico.com/home/" title="Gabriel Rico's web site, with a Flash animation that shows the clustering technique">at the top of Rico's web site</a>.

I'd used clustering dozens of times for my non-fiction writing (and also for general problem-solving), so I knew it was a great technique for tapping the creative, associative workings of your mind.  But I hadn't yet used clustering to develop story ideas for fiction, and this was a great opportunity.

So that's how I would develop ideas into story ideas.  Where would I find the raw, undeveloped ideas to cluster about?  From my brand new copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582974934/dalehemery-20"><em>The Writer's Book of Matches</em></a>, a small book filled with hundreds of intriguing writing prompts.

So I had plan:
<ol>
	<li>Pick a random prompt from <em>The Writer's Book of Matches</em>.</li>
	<li>Cluster around the core idea of the prompt until a story idea hit me.</li>
	<li>Write down the story idea.</li>
	<li>Write the story.</li>
</ol>
Then I went to work.

<strong>My first prompt</strong> was:
<blockquote><em>"He's probably just as disappointed in me as I am in him."</em></blockquote>
The core of this idea is mutual disappointment.  But who are the people involved, and what are they disappointed about?  This is a great job for clustering.  I grabbed my pen and an 8"x5" index card and drew this cluster (rendered here using <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/us/">MindJet's MindManager</a> software):

<strong>Cluster for "Dinner at Gourlay's"</strong> (click for full size)

As I dumped associations onto the card, I quickly found a story idea (in the branches I've bolded on the map):
<blockquote>A father has long expressed disappointment in his son's sexual promiscuity.  Then the son catches the father having an affair.</blockquote>
This story idea had some real juice for me, especially if I wrote it from the son's point of view.  I didn't want to cluster any more, I wanted to write.  I dashed off a 1,000-word first draft of a story called "Dinner at Gourlay's".

<strong>The next prompt</strong> that I pulled out of <em>The Writer's Book of Matches</em> was:
<blockquote><em>"It's supposed to be a game, but he treats it like life and death."</em></blockquote>
The key words seemed to be <em>life</em>, <em>death</em>, and <em>game</em>, so I put those words in the center of an index card and created this cluster:

<strong>Cluster for "Double or Nothing"</strong> (click for full size)
<p align="left">This time the story didn't jump out at me instantly.  It took a whole five minutes to find an idea that interested me.  The "bet too much" bubble caught my attention because it connected game with death.  Digging yourself too deeply into debt with your bookie (so the stereotype goes) can put you at serious bodily risk.  So imagine a guy deeply in debt and being threatened by his bookie.  What might the guy do?  Maybe he'd kill the bookie, or try to.  Then I thought of a twist:  What if the guy bets a second bookie that he can kill the one to whom he's in debt?  After a few more twists, I had enough of an idea to start writing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">Norm is deeply in debt to his bookie Paulo.  He tries to hire Emile, a competing bookie, to kill Paulo.  But Emile doesn't like the idea.  Instead, he offers a deal:  If <em>Norm</em> can kill the Paulo in a week, Emile will pay off the debt.  If Norm <em>can't</em> kill Paulo in a week, Emile will still pay off the debt, but then Norm will owe Emile twice the amount he owed Paulo.  Double or nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><em>That</em> prompt led to <em>this</em> story idea?  Cool!</p>
<p align="left">I wrote the first scene, which I quite like.  But at the moment I don't know where the story goes next.  I like the idea that the Emile tips off Paulo that Norm is coming to kill him, but so far I can't figure out Emile's motivation to do that.  But it would be fun, so I'll keep looking.</p>
<p align="left">Time for more clustering.</p>
