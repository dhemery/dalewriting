Why do fiction magazines take so long to respond to submissions?

The obvious answer is that they receive many,
many submissions per month.
But I'm pretty sure that answer is wrong.

If the delay were due to receiving submissions
at a rate faster than then can reply,
their response time would steadily and rapidly increase.
Let's see why.
For simplicity,
let's assume that all submissions arrive on the first day of the month,
and they send all replies on the last day.

Imagine a magazine that received 100 submissions per month,
but can only respond to 50 per month.
Let's number the submissions S001–S100.
After the first month,
they would have replied to fifty submissions,
numbered S001–S050,
with a response time of one month.
And they would have a backlog of submissions S051–S100.

In the second month,
they would receive another 100 submissions
(S101--S200).
And they would respond to the first fifty in the backlog.
And the fifty they respond to
would be the ones that were already in the backlog
at the start of the month
(S051--S100).
The response time for those would be 2 months.
 And they would not be able to respond to any of the new submissions.
They would end the month with 100 submissions
(S101--S200)
in the backlog.

The third month they would respond to the first fifty in the queue
(S101--S150),
all of which have been in the backlog
since the beginning of the second month.
The response for those would be 2 months.
Over the month,
they would receive 100 more submissions
(S201--S300).
 They would end the third month with 150 submissions in the backlog
 (S151--S300).

The fourth month
they would respond to the first 50 submissions in the backlog
(S151--S200),
each of which has been in the backlog
since the start of the second month.
The response time for those would be 3 months.
They would receive another 100 submissions
and end the month with 200 submissions
(S201--S400)
in the backlog.

Every month,
the backlog grows.
And every month the average response time grows.
This is always what happens if submissions arrive
at a rate faster than the magazine can respond.
(More generally,
this is what happens to any system when jobs arrive at a rate faster than the system completes them.)
The backlog grows without bound,
and
(if every submission stays in the queue)
the response time also grows without bound.

But for most magazines the response does not increase.
 So the problem cannot be that submissions arrive faster than the magazine can respond.
 If the response time stays exactly the same,
then the magazine must be responding to exactly as many submissions each month as it receives.

The problem is not that submissions arrive faster than the magazine can respond.
The problem is that the backlog has a lot of stories in it.

For such a magazine,
where there is a long delay,
yet they respond at the same rate that submissions arrive,
there is a simple way to
(nearly)
eliminate the delays:
Close down submissions until the backlog is gone.
Then when you re-open for submissions,
you can respond to them at the rate you always have,
but the response time will be near zero.
