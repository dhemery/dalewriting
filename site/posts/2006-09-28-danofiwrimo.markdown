Several years ago, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811845052/104-3420659-4046314?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dalehemer-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0811845052">Chris Baty</a> and some of his insane friends created the National Novel Writing Month, or <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>.  The idea is to write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November.  Many people use the month to create what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385480016/104-3420659-4046314?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dalehemer-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0385480016">Anne Lamott calls</a> "a shitty first draft," and then use the following year to rewrite the draft into a passable novel.

This year I want to do something similar, but with non-fiction.  I'm tempted to call it NaNoFiWriMo, or National Non-Fiction Writing Month, but I'm refraining for two reasons.  First, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nanofiwrimo">at least two other people</a> already thought of that.  Second, I don't care whether this goes national; I'm doing it for myself.

So I'm calling it Dale's Non-Fiction Writing Month, or DaNoFiWriMo.  I've chosen October for my first DaNoFiWriMo, because for the first time in years I have a whole month with no scheduled training or consulting.

Part of the NaNoWriMo process is making a public commitment.  I hate that.  But I hate it less now than I will three days from now, so here goes:  <strong>I will write a 50,000 word draft of a non-fiction book in October, 2006.</strong>  I'll let you guess the topic.

Do we still switch to standard time in October?  I could use the extra hour.
