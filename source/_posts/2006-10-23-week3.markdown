This week I wrote more words than I expected for each topic.  I also wrote less coherently.  During the first two weeks I usually had some idea of what I wanted to say about a topic.  This week my writing was more of a brain dump.  It will be interesting to see what it's like to edit this week's writing.

I drew mind maps for two big topics:  how relationships affect resistance, and how context or environmental factors affect resistance.  The mind maps give me plenty to write aboutâ€”probably several days worth of writing for each topic.

I didn't expect to write last night.  I expected to rest for a class I'm teaching with Elisabeth Hendrickson.  But at 10pm I got the itch to write.  I ended up writing 2200 words in an hour and a half, and got too little sleep.  I'm taking tonight off to get some well-earned rest.
